We have made every attempt to present data free from errors of either omission or 
commission but, as in any human endeavor, there will be errors.  This does not diminish 
the value of these data to the scientific community. Ultimately, the users of these data are 
responsible for ensuring that the quality of the data is sufficient for their intended uses. If 
you plan to use these data in such a way that any errors in the data would have severe 
consequences you should contact the authors of the relevant Water Resources Research 
papers to access the original raw data and do any additional data reduction to meet your 
own specific needs.
