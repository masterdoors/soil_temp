This data is the final data. Each file has a version indentifier in its header.
The current version is 1.00 which was written on 07November2001. Any version of 
these files dated prior to 07November2001 or without a version information
line in the header is not the current version and should be disfavored and
replaced by this final data. 

The datestamp of the datafiles may change (as a result if restoring backups and
other system events) but the version number in the file header should be considered 
definitive of the status of the datafiles.
