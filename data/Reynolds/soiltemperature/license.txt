The people of the United States of America caused, through their government, for these 
data to be collected, processed and presented in their current format. Therefore, these data 
are in the public domain. These data do not have any copyright restrictions. The Center 
for the Public Domain (http://centerforthepublicdomain.org/resources/pd.html) is a good 
starting point to explore the "public domain."

We do ask that the customary courtesies of proper citation and assignation be followed.  
The proper citation may be found in the header of each datafile. We also ask that two 
copies of any published works be sent to the librarian of the Northwest Watershed 
Research Center.
